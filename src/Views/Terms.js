      </p>
      <p>
        Curate Mobile™ will never share, sell, rent, exchange or barter your Personal Data to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing purposes. By making that Personal Data available to Curate Mobile™, you grant Curate Mobile™ the right, subject to applicable law, to use that Personal Data (other than Sensitive Information) to contact you by telephone and email regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us, please follow the instructions at the end of each such marketing message, or see the “Opt-Out/Unsubscribe” section below.

        We will also use your Personal Data for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience with the Curate Mobile™ Offerings and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. We may also use your Personal Data for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our service offerings including, without limitation, the Curate Mobile™ Offerings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from User lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our Users’ Personal Data solely as needed to perform these functions for us, but we do not permit them to use User Personal Data for other purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times, we may want to contact you via telephone regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. To enable us to contact you by telephone regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™, you agree that by submitting your Personal Data by and through the Curate Mobile™ Offerings, such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times, we may want to contact you via your mobile device regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. To enable us to contact your mobile device, you agree that, where you provide “prior express written consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC § 227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200), as amended from time-to-time (“TCPA”), you consent to receive telephone calls, including artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls delivered via automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided. Please note that you are not required to provide this consent in order to obtain access to the Curate Mobile™ Offerings, and your consent simply allows Curate Mobile™ to contact you via these means. Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to us changes. Without limiting the foregoing, if you: (a) have your telephone number reassigned to another person or entity; (b) give up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you; (c) port your telephone number to a landline or vice versa; or (d) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason (collectively “Phone Number Change”), you agree that you shall promptly notify Curate Mobile™ of the Phone Number Change via e-mail at: privacy@curatemobile.com, or by using one of the methods set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.

        Security
      </p>
      <p>
        We endeavor to safeguard and protect our Users’ Personal Data. When Users make Personal Data available to us, their Personal Data is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any Personal Data offline). Where we ask Users to enter Sensitive Information, if ever, and when we store and transmit such Sensitive Information, that information is encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).]
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to your Personal Data is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your Personal Data is not accessible to the public. All of our Users’ Personal Data is restricted in our offices, as well as the offices of our third-party service providers. Only employees or third-party agents who need User Personal Data to perform a specific job are granted access to User Personal Data. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all User Personal Data. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. The servers that we store User Personal Data on are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Data under our control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet or via wireless networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your Personal Data, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your Personal Data; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software may constitute a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your Personal Data will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Site, other Curate Mobile™ Offerings or otherwise via the Internet or wireless networks, is done at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        In compliance with applicable law, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Data. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
