The Site is an Internet property of Curate Mobile Ltd. (“Curate Mobile™,” “we,” “our” or “us”). The following Curate Mobile™ Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets forth our policies for the collection, storage and usage of your “Personal Data.” For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. This includes information such as your name, your address, your phone number and your email address.</p><p>Please note, Curate Mobile™ is considered the “Data Controller” in connection with the Personal Data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for purposes of applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). We only collect Personal Data that you provide to us, e.g. during the registration process or for the purpose of handling the contractual relationship that you have with Curate Mobile™, and only to the extent necessary for those purposes. Further, we only use and store your Personal Data if you have given us your express consent or, in the alternative, to the extent that you have explicitly granted us permission, e.g. pursuant to the contractual relationship between you and Curate Mobile™.</p><p>Background</p><p>Without limiting the foregoing, this Privacy Policy covers our treatment of Personal Data and other information that we collect when an end-user visitor to the Site (“User,” “you” or “your”): (a) accesses certain information relating to the Curate Mobile™ Offerings (as defined below), including text, images, graphics and other material made available by Curate Mobile™ (collectively, “Curate Mobile™ Content”); (b) accesses certain features of the online interface and associated mobile marketing services made available by Curate Mobile™ (collectively, the “Platform”), which enables: (i) individuals and/or entities that register as publishers (“Publishers”) to perform mobile marketing services for individuals and/or entities that have registered as Curate Mobile™ advertisers (“Advertisers”); and (iii) where applicable, individuals and/or entities to register as Advertisers and obtain the mobile services of registered Publishers in connection with the Platform; (c) accesses links to Curate Mobile’s™ social media pages/accounts (collectively, “Social Media Pages”) featured on third-party social media websites, such as Facebook® and LinkedIn® (collectively, “Social Media Websites”); and/or (d) accesses the various contact forms (“Forms”) and/or contact information made available on the Site as a means to contact directly, or request to be contacted by, Curate Mobile™ (collectively, the “Contact Services,” and together with the Site, Curate Mobile™ Content and Platform, the “Curate Mobile™ Offerings”).</p><p>In order to register as an Advertiser, you must enter into the Curate Mobile Advertiser Agreement (“Advertiser Agreement”) and in order to register as a Publisher, you must enter into the Curate Mobile Publisher Agreement (“Publisher Agreement,” and together with the Advertiser Agreement, the “Network Agreements”).</p><p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE OFFERINGS.</p><p>Facebook® is a registered trademark of Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”). LinkedIn® is a registered trademark of LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn”). Please be advised that Curate Mobile™ is not in any way affiliated with Facebook or LinkedIn, and the Curate Mobile™ Offerings are not endorsed, administered or sponsored by Facebook or LinkedIn.</p><p>Your California Privacy Rights</p><p>Curate Mobile™ will never share, sell, rent, exchange or barter your Personal Data to or with any third-party for financial gain or marketing purposes. Nevertheless, we may, in certain limited instances, share your Personal Data with third parties who perform administrative functions on our behalf. If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to learn how your “Personal Data” (as defined in the Shine the Light Law, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83) is shared with third parties, what categories of Personal Data/personal information that we have shared with third parties in the preceding year, as well as the names and addresses of those third parties, please e-mail us at: privacy@curatemobile.com; call us at: (416) 840-4619; or send us mail to: Curate Mobile Ltd., 8 Market Street, Suite 500, Toronto, Ontario, M5E 1M6, Canada.</p><p>Personal Data Collected</p><p>We collect Personal Data when you access certain of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings and complete the required information request form and/or otherwise provide such information to us. For example, in connection with obtaining access to the Platform as an Advertiser or a Publisher, and/or otherwise completing the Site registration process, Curate Mobile™ will collect the following information applicable to the User: (a) the name of the User’s business entity (“Entity”) (as well as any applicable Entity’s trade name and business entity type (e.g., corporation, limited liability company, partnership, etc.)); (b) the Entity’s street address; (c) the Entity’s primary contact’s full name; (d) the Entity’s primary contact’s e-mail address; (e) the Entity’s primary contact’s telephone number; (f) the Entity’s primary contact’s fax number; (g) the Entity’s billing address; (h) the Entity’s preferred method of payment (credit and/or debit card information); and/or (i) any other information requested on the applicable form.

By making that Personal Data available to Curate Mobile™, you grant Curate Mobile™ the right, subject to applicable law, to use that Personal Data (other than Sensitive Information) to contact you by telephone and email regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us, please follow the instructions at the end of each such marketing message, or see the “Opt-Out/Unsubscribe” section below.</p><p>We will also use your Personal Data for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience with the Curate Mobile™ Offerings and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. We may also use your Personal Data for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our service offerings including, without limitation, the Curate Mobile™ Offerings.</p><p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from User lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our Users’ Personal Data solely as needed to perform these functions for us, but we do not permit them to use User Personal Data for other purposes.</p><p>At times, we may want to contact you via telephone regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. To enable us to contact you by telephone regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™, you agree that by submitting your Personal Data by and through the Curate Mobile™ Offerings, such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.</p><p>At times, we may want to contact you via your mobile device regarding your use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings. To enable us to contact your mobile device, you agree that, where you provide “prior express written consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC § 227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200), as amended from time-to-time (“TCPA”), you consent to receive telephone calls, including artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls delivered via automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided. Please note that you are not required to provide this consent in order to obtain access to the Curate Mobile™ Offerings, and your consent simply allows Curate Mobile™ to contact you via these means. Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to us changes. Without limiting the foregoing, if you: (a) have your telephone number reassigned to another person or entity; (b) give up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you; (c) port your telephone number to a landline or vice versa; or (d) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason (collectively “Phone Number Change”), you agree that you shall promptly notify Curate Mobile™ of the Phone Number Change via e-mail at: privacy@curatemobile.com, or by using one of the methods set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.</p><p>We reserve the right to release current or past Personal Data, including Sensitive Information: (i) in the event that we believe that the Curate Mobile™ Offerings are being or have been used in material violation of the Terms and Conditions and/or Network Agreements or to commit unlawful acts; (ii) if the information is subpoenaed; provided, however, that, where permitted by applicable law, we shall provide you with e-mail notice, and opportunity to challenge the subpoena, prior to disclosure of any Personal Data pursuant to a subpoena; (iii) to comply with a legal obligation, including sharing your name/e-mail address with third-parties to assist you with your opt out requests in compliance with applicable law, including the GDPR and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time-to-time; (iv) to protect and defend the rights or property of the Company and/or its other Users; (v) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or the public; or (vi) if we are sold, merge with a third party, are acquired or are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that if Curate Mobile™ is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Data, as well as any choices that you may have regarding your Personal Data.</p><p>Non-Personal Data Collection and Use IP Addresses/Browser Type We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your desktop computer and/or mobile device when you visit many of the pages of the Site. This non-personally identifiable information includes, without limitation, the type of browser that you use (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer), your IP address, the type of operating system that you use (e.g., Windows or iOS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, AT&amp;T).

We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze usage of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings.</p><p>Cookies</p><p>When a User visits the Site, and that User agrees to the terms of our cookie policy, we send one (1) or more cookies and/or gif files (collectively, “Cookies”) to assign a unique identifier to the applicable User’s computer.

Nevertheless, most Internet browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting. In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the User’s Internet browser notifies other websites that the User does not want his/her Information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral advertising.</p><p>Cross Device Tracking</p><p>Curate Mobile™ does not track Users’ use of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings across multiple devices, including personal computers and Mobile Devices.</p><p>Aggregate Data</p><p>Curate Mobile™ reserves the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or group data about Users of the Curate Mobile™ Offerings for lawful purposes.

Curate Mobile™ requires that its third party payment processing service provider(s) has/have in place privacy policies and practices consistent with this Privacy Policy; provided, however, that we cannot guarantee the privacy practices of our third party payment processing service provider(s).</p><p>Social Media Websites/Interactive Services</p><p>If you engage in any interaction with Curate Mobile™, other Users or any third party on any Social Media Pages or via the Interactive Services, you should be aware that: (a) the Personal Data that you submit by and through such Social Media Pages and/or Interactive Services, as applicable, can be read, collected and/or used by other users of these websites/services (depending on your privacy settings associated with your accounts with the applicable Social Media Websites), and could be used to send you unsolicited messages or otherwise to contact you without your consent or desire; and (b) where Curate Mobile™ responds to any interaction on such Social Media Pages, your account name/handle may be viewable by any and all members/users of Curate Mobile’s™ social media accounts.</p><p>We are not responsible for the Personal Data that you choose to submit on any Social Media Websites or via the Interactive Services. The Social Media Websites operate independently from Curate Mobile™, and we are not responsible for such Social Media Websites’ interfaces or privacy or security practices.
